# Genetic Algorithm for Knapsack Problem

This program implements a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem, exported as a readme file and docx. 

## Problem Definition

The knapsack problem is defined as:

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a knapsack such that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is maximized. 

## Algorithm 

A genetic algorithm is used to find a near-optimal solution to the knapsack problem.

**Key steps:**

- A genome represents a candidate solution as a binary vector. 1 represents including the item, 0 represents excluding it.

- An initial population of random genomes is generated. 

- The fitness function calculates the total value of items included, penalizing genomes that exceed the weight limit.

- Parents are selected via a tournament selection method. 

- Offspring are generated by crossover and mutation of parent genomes.

- The least fit individual is replaced by the offspring in the population.

- This continues for a defined number of generations.

- The genome with the highest fitness provides the final solution.

**Parameters:**

- Population size
- Number of generations
- Mutation rate
- Tournament size

**Functions:**

- `generate_genome()`: creates a random genome.

- `calculate_fitness()`: evaluates the fitness of a genome.

- `select_parent()`: selects parent via tournament selection.

- `crossover()`: crosses over two parent genomes.

- `mutate()`: mutates a genome. 

- `dispRes()`: displays selected items from best genome.

## Usage

To run the program:

`python knapsack.py`

The best fitness and selected items will be printed at the end.

Parameters can be tuned in the code for different problem instances.

## Future Improvements

- Load data from a file rather than hardcoding.

- Track fitness over generations to see convergence.

- Add elitism by keeping top individuals.

- Implement different crossover and mutation approaches.

- Add parallelization for performance.

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates a genetic algorithm effectively generating near-optimal solutions to the knapsack problem. There are many possible extensions to improve performance and applicability.
